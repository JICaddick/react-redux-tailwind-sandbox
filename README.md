This create-react-app application is a sandbox. 

It's been used to create an 'about us' page and before being used for tailwind. Product preview card built for the dekstop version of a perfume product. We then built the mobile version- this part was a good lesson in responsiveness. 

From there a React Router was installed along with links to a voucher and click to confirm, 2 'home' buttons and 1 'back' button on the grandchild.
